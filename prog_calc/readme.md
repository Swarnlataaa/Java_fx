### Please follow these steps to configure JavaFX in your project:

1. Make sure you have JavaFX installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Oracle website.

2. In your Java project, go to your project's build path settings. You can usually find this under the project's properties or settings.

3. Add the JavaFX library to your project's build path. To do this, click on the "Libraries" or "Build Path" tab and select "Add Library" or "Add External JARs".

4. Locate the JavaFX library JAR files on your system. The location may vary depending on your JavaFX installation. The required JAR files are usually named `jfxrt.jar` and `javafx-swt.jar`.

5. Select the JavaFX library JAR files and click "OK" to add them to your project's build path.

6. Clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the changes take effect.

After following these steps, the `javafx` package should be resolved, and you should be able to compile and run your JavaFX program without any issues.
